Ah, you can talk about the pit, barbecue
The band was jumpin', the people too
Ah, mess around

They doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around,
Everybody doin' the mess around

Ah, everybody was juiced, you can, bet your soul
They did the boogie-woogie, with a sturdy roll
They mess around

They doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around,
Everybody doin' the mess around

Now, ah, when I say stop don't you move a peg
When I say go, just ah, shake your leg
And do the mess around
I declare, do the mess around
Yeah do the mess around,
Everybody's doin' the mess around
Now let me have it there boy
