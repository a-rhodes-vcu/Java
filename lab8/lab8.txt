LAB	8 – Arrays
1. Create a class called CustomerListerArray with a main method that declares and
instantiates an array of String objects called customerName. The array should have room for
seven String objects. Assign each of the following Strings to sequential locations in the array
beginning at array index 0. Do not use an array initializer list to create the customerName
array.
Chris
Lois
Meg
Peter
Stewie
Write an enhanced for loop to display the array of names so that each name is on a separate line.
In the comments text box in the Blackboard assignment link answer the following questions:
• What is displayed for the last two array elements?
• Why is it that value?
Add the Strings “Meg” and “Brian” into index 3, and 4, respectively, so that the array contains the
following elements in this order:
Chris
Lois
Meg
Meg
Brian
Peter
Stewie
Write another enhanced for loop to display the array of names.
Write a second, traditional for loop that checks each element for the String “Meg”, if found in the
array, remove it, shift the remaining elements, and display the array of names.
In the comments text box answer the question:
• Are both instances of “Meg” removed correctly from the array?
• Why or why not? In other words, explain what you observe in your code.
